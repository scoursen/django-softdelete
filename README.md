django-softdelete
=================

This project provides undelete of soft-deleted objects, along with proper undeletion of related objects.

Requirements
------------

* Django >=1.7
* `django.contrib.contenttypes`

Installation
------------

1. There are simple templates files in `templates/`.  You will need to add Django's egg loader to use the templates as is:

        TEMPLATE_LOADERS = (
            ...
            'django.template.loaders.eggs.Loader',
        )

2. Add the project 'softdelete' to your `INSTALLED_APPS` for through-the-web undelete support.

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'softdelete',
        )

Under The Hood
--------------

Central to the ability to undelete a soft-deleted model is the concept of changesets.  When you
soft-delete an object, any objects referencing it via a `ForeignKey`, `ManyToManyField`, or `OneToOneField` will
also be soft-deleted.  This mimics the traditional `CASCADE` behavior of a SQL `DELETE`.

When the soft-delete is performed, the system makes a `ChangeSet` object which tracks all affected objects of
this delete request.  Later, when an undelete is requested, this `ChangeSet` is referenced to do a cascading 
undelete.

If you are undeleting an object that was part of a `ChangeSet`, that entire `ChangeSet` is undeleted.  

Once undeleted, the `ChangeSet` object is removed from the underlying database with a regular ("hard") delete.

Testing
-------

Can be tested directly with the following command:

    django-admin.py test softdelete --settings="softdelete.settings"
